## Portfolio
### Projects
[Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation](/Multimodal-Brain-Tumor-Segmentation)
- Segmentation of gliomas in pre-operative MRI scans. Used the provided clinically-acquired training data to produce segmentation labels.
- Pre-processed the provided clinically-acquired training data and applied simple **U-Net** as semantic segmentation model and **Dice Coefficient** as metrics for evaluation. Used Keras 
as framework.
- Achieved dice coefficient score of **0.9950** for lower grade glioma (LGG) and **0.9814** for glioblastoma (GBM/HGG).

---
[Adversarial Example Attack and Defense](/Adversarial-Example-Attack-and-Defense)
- Implemented three adversarial example attacks and one defense using *MNIST* dataset using PyTorch as framework.
- Achieved **~70% reduction** in test accuracy during the attacks, namely **FGSM, I-FGSM and MI-FGSM**.
- Used **Defensive Distillation** method as countermeasure to these attacks and achieved with only **~2% reduction** in test accuracy during the attacks.

[Generation of Adversarial Examples using DCGAN (Pokemon Dataset)](/Adversarial-Examples-of-Pokemon)
- Implemented **DC-GAN** using PyTorch as framework and applied it on Pokemon dataset fetched from kaggle.
- Achieved Discriminator to get fooled with the created adversarial examples with **99.96% accuracy (Training)**.

---
[Fundamental Brain Wave Extractor](/Fundamental-Brain-Waves-Extractor)
- Brainwaves can then be categorized based on their level of activity or frequency. There are five fundamental brain waves, Gamma, Beta, Alpha, Theta and Delta wave.
- Implemented a **Multi-Band Filtering Design System** using **MATLAB** which can be used to extract these five fundamental brain waves. 
- Filter Design is based on **Chebyshev Type-I approximation (analog)**, used **Bilinear Transformation** to convert analog filter to digital filter.

[Dog vs Cat Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/arya791/kernel6fb4bf1ec6)
- Classification between dog and cat. Used the Dogs-vs-Cats (redux) dataset from kaggle competition.
- Designed own model using Keras, achieved **F1 score of 91.50% and Log loss of 2.97 with validation and Log loss of 3.09 with test data**. 

---
[Devanagari character recognition](https://github.com/as791/Devanagari-character-recognition)
- Character Recognition of the Devanagri, **58** different classes to classify.
- Built CNN using Keras, achieved **99.69% of test accuracy.**
